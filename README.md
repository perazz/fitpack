fortran-fitpack
===

This is a Modern Fortran translation of the FITPACK package for curve and surface fitting.
The functions are modernized and translated from the original Fortran77 code [FITPACK](http://www.netlib.org/dierckx) by Paul Dierckx.
The starting code used the double precision version of FITPACK distributed with [scipy](http://www.scipy.org).
An object-oriented interface wrapper is also being built. 

Building, using
===============

An automated build is available via the Fortran Package Manager. To use FITPACK within your FPM project, add the following to your fpm.toml file:

```
[dependencies]
fitpack = { git="https://github.com/perazz/fitpack.git" }
```

Otherwise, a simple command line build script is: 
```
gfortran src/fitpack_core.f90 test/fitpack_test_data.f90 test/fitpack_tests.f90 src/fitpack.f90 test/test.f90 -o fitpack_test.exe
```

- `src/fitpack_core.f90` contains the refactored package
- `src/fitpack.f90` contains the object-oriented interface
- `test/fitpack_tests.f90` contains the original test programs, refactored as subroutines. 
- `test/fitpack_test_data.f90` contains support data to the original test programs
- `test/test.f90` is the test driver program 

A simple makefile for the GNU compiler suite is provided in folder `project`; to run it: 

```
cd project/
make -f makefile.gcc
```

The testing executable is just a wrapper to the 29 original test programs. 
These test programs aren't double checked yet, and their output is supposed to be the original F77 program output
